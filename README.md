# ColorQuest

<p>ColorQuest is a fun, puzzling game for artists and brainiacs alike, starting off with a given color, and mixing, mixing, mixing until your color matches. Features are an intuitive, aesthetically pleasing interface, simple controls, and fun and addicting gameplay. The game was built to test one’s mind while also brightening their day with all of these colors. But don’t mix too many colors, lest you have to start again from scratch! Hone your color-mixing skills and improve your high score. Remember, you don’t have much time and only have 5 checks for your mixtures before the game’s over, so better mix smartly and quickly.</p>
